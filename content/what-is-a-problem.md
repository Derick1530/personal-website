description: My definition of the word "problem"

I have been dissatisfied with every definition of the word "problem" I have come across, so I wrote my own.

---

## My definition

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction to the momentum of the transition from an entity's current state to a desired one.

This definition is compelling because it identifies the 7 components a situation needs to be categorized as a problem:

1. **Entity** <br>The person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>The current characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
3. **Desired state** <br>The desired characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
4. **Momentum** <br>The attempt to change the entity's state from current to desired
5. **Transition** <br>The change in the entity's state from current to desired
6. **Friction** <br>The force slowing or preventing the transition
7. **Obstacle** <br>The source of friction

## Conclusion

I believe if my definition holds weight, all 7 components should be found in all problems, but if they can't, my definition will need additional revisions.

I look forward to putting it to the test.
