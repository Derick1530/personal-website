title: What is a problem?
description: My definition of the word "problem"

I have been dissatisfied with every definition of the word "problem" I have come across, so I wrote my own.

---

## My definition

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction to the momentum of the transition from an entity's current state to a desired one.

This definition is compelling because it identifies the 7 components a situation needs to be categorized as a problem:

1. **Entity** <br>The person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>The current characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
3. **Desired state** <br>The desired characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
4. **Momentum** <br>The attempt to change the entity's state from current to desired
5. **Transition** <br>The change in the entity's state from current to desired
6. **Friction** <br>The force slowing or preventing the transition
7. **Obstacle** <br>The source of friction

## Applying my definition to real problems

### Problem 1: Raw analysis

> I want to be a Full Stack Software Engineer. I found free websites to learn, but I don't know all the necessary topics.

In this case, the <mark>entity</mark> is the person, and their <mark>desired state</mark> is being a Full Stack Software Engineer.

The <mark>momentum</mark> is their attempt to find learning material with a seemingly <mark>low-friction obstacle</mark> being the person not knowing what to specifically learn about.

This person's <mark>current state</mark> is not known, so it isn't obvious if overcoming the obstacle will <mark>transition</mark> the person to their desired state.

However, intuition tells me this person's desired state is a long term goal, so there are many desired states between their current state and their goal. 

### Problem 1: Defining the problem

In order to provide an actionable solution, the problem must be clearly defined, and to do this, I would talk with them to clearly identify their current state and a new desired state that feels more straightforward to transition to.

After this, a rephrasing of the problem would be something like:

> This person has discovered free websites to teach themselves Full Stack Software Engineering, and they want to start. However, after seeing how much there is to learn, they don't know what to learn first.

### Problem 1: Solving the problem

Once the problem is clearly defined, solving it can begin by posing the simple question:

> What should they learn first?

## Conclusion

So far my definition appears to be valid because it has been possible to derive all 7 components from the problem I analyzed.

With that said, I still have a lot more analysis to do, but I look forward to the ideas that will take shape as I deepen my research.
