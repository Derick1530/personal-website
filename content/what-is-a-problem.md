title: What is a “problem”?
description: My definition of the word "problem"

Here's my definition of a **problem**.

> "A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction against an entity's transition from a current state to a desired new state." - Shadow Smith

This definition is compelling to me because it identifies the 7 ingredients a **situation** needs to be categorized as a **problem**.

## The 7 ingredients

![Problem Diagram](/img/what-is-a-problem/problem-diagram.svg "Problem Diagram")

1. **Entity** <br>A person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>A current characteristic and/or circumstance of the entity
3. **New state** <br>A new characteristic and/or circumstance of the entity
4. **Transition** <br>A change in the entity's state from a current state to a new state
5. **Obstacle** <br>A source of friction pushing against the transition
6. **Friction** <br>A force capable of stopping a transition
7. **Desire** <br>A want for the entity to be in a specific new state

## Examining real problems using my definition and the 7 ingredients

I saw someone share the following problem in an online forum, and I'm going to use my definition to break it down.

> I want to be a Full Stack Software Engineer. I found free websites to learn, but I don't know all the necessary topics.

The <mark>entity</mark> is a **person**, their <mark>current state</mark> is **not being a Full Stack Software Engineer**, and their desired <mark>new state</mark> is **being a Full Stack Software Engineer**.

They encountered an <mark>obstacle</mark> of **not knowing what to learn** that has applied <mark>enough friction</mark> to their <mark>transition</mark> to stop them from **being a Full Stack Software Engineer**.

Interestingly, when an <mark>entity</mark> encounters an <mark>obstacle</mark>, the state of being faced with that <mark>obstacle</mark> _is_ a <mark>current state</mark> of the <mark>entity</mark> itself with an obvious desired <mark>new state</mark> of no longer being faced with that <mark>obstacle</mark>.

Therefore, their problem statement could also be:

> I don't know what to learn to be a Full Stack Software Engineer.

Again, the <mark>entity</mark> is a **person**, their <mark>current state</mark> is **not knowing what to learn**, and their desired <mark>new state</mark> is **knowing what to learn**.

They encountered an <mark>obstacle</mark> of **not having an easily accessible resource of information about becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer** that has applied <mark>enough friction</mark> to their <mark>transition</mark> to stop them from **knowing what to learn**.

With the <mark>entity</mark> encountering an <mark>obstacle</mark> of **not having an easily accessible resource of information about becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer**, their <mark>current state</mark> _is_ **not having an easily accessible resource of information about becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer** with an obvious desired <mark>new state</mark> of **having an easily accessible resource of information about becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer**.

Therefore, their problem statement could also be:

> I don't have an easily accessible resource of information about becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer.

## The Situation Fractal

Situations with 6 of the [7 ingredients](#the-7-ingredients) constantly happen all the time, but it is specifically **Desire** that turns a **situation** into a **problem**.

Specifically, an <mark>entity</mark> can <mark>transition</mark> from a <mark>current state</mark> to a <mark>new state</mark> against the <mark>friction</mark> of an encountered <mark>obstacle</mark>, but if there is no <mark>desire</mark> for the <mark>entity</mark> to be in a specific <mark>new state</mark>, the **situation** <u>is not</u> a **problem**.

In fact, situations occur with every entity in the universe where they transition from a current state to a new state against the friction of encountered obstacles as they move through time, and below is a visual of what I believe a section of this [fractal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fractal) looks like:

![Situation Fractal](/img/what-is-a-problem/situation-fractal.svg "Situation Fractal")

Therefore, if there is no <mark>desire</mark> to transition to a specific <mark>new state</mark>, there is no **problem** while an <mark>entity</mark> traverses different states in their **Situation Fractal**, but the moment a <mark>new state</mark> is desired, a **problem** now exists.

Below is what a **problem** in a **Situation Fractal** looks like.

## The 2 states of a Problem

If all [7 ingredients](#the-7-ingredients) are present, a **situation** is _always_ a **problem**, but whether or not someone _believes_ a **situation** is a **problem** depends on which state a problem is currently in.

The 2 states of a problems are:

1. **Unsolved** <br>This is when an obstacle <mark>applies enough friction</mark> to stop an entity's transition from a current state to a desired new state.
2. **Solved** <br>This is when an obstacle <mark>doesn't apply enough friction</mark> to stop an entity's transition from a current state to a desired new state.

So **Friction** is also a critical ingredient to whether or not a **situation** is generally considered a **problem**, but I would argue that if **Desire** for a specific state is present, a **situation** _is_ a **problem** regardless of _how much_ **Friction** is being applied.
