title: What is a problem?
description: My definition of the word "problem"

I have been dissatisfied with every definition of the word "problem" I have come across, so I wrote my own.

---

## My definition

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction to the momentum of the transition from an entity's current state to a desired one.

This definition is compelling because it identifies the 7 components a situation needs to be categorized as a problem:

1. **Entity** <br>The person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>The current characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
3. **Desired state** <br>The desired characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
4. **Momentum** <br>The attempt to change the entity's state from current to desired
5. **Transition** <br>The change in the entity's state from current to desired
6. **Friction** <br>The force slowing or preventing the transition
7. **Obstacle** <br>The source of friction

## Applying my definition to real problems

### Problem 1: Raw Analysis

> I want to be a Full Stack Software Engineer. I found free websites to learn, but I don't know all the necessary topics.

In this case, the <mark>entity</mark> is the person, and their <mark>desired state</mark> is being a Full Stack Software Engineer.

The <mark>momentum</mark> is their attempt to find learning material with a seemingly <mark>low-friction obstacle</mark> being the person not knowing what to specifically learn about.

This person's <mark>current state</mark> is not known, so it isn't obvious if overcoming the obstacle will <mark>transition</mark> the person to their desired state.

Intuition tells me this person's desired state is a long term goal, so there are many desired states between their current state and their goal. 

So in order to better assist, I would first clearly identify this person's current state and work with them to determine a new desired state that can easily be transitioned to through a low-friction obstacle.

### Problem 1: Capturing

> This person has discovered free websites to teach themselves Full Stack Software Engineering, and they want to start. However, after seeing how much there is to learn, they don't know where to begin.

## Conclusion

I believe if my definition holds weight, all 7 components should be found in all problems, but if they can't, my definition will need additional revisions.

I look forward to putting it to the test.
