I have been dissatisfied with every definition of the term "problem" I have been able to find on the internet, so I decided to try and write my own.

Here's what I've come up with:

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle adds friction to the transition of an entity from its current state to a desired one.

I feel this definition is compelling because it identifies the following components that are necessary for a situation to be categorized as a problem:

1. **Obstacle** <br>The source of friction
2. **Friction** <br>The force slowing or preventing the transition
3. **Transition** <br>The action that is intended to change the entity's state
4. **Entity** <br>The person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
5. **Current state** <br>The current characteristics and circumstances of the entity
6. **Desired state** <br>The new characteristics and circumstances of the entity

I'm going to continue to try and poke holes in this definition, but I feel it is a solid starting point.
