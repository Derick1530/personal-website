title: What is a problem?
description: My definition of the word "problem"

I have been dissatisfied with every definition of the word "problem" I have come across, so I wrote my own.

---

## My definition

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction to the momentum of the transition from an entity's current state to a desired one.

This definition is compelling because it identifies the 7 components a situation needs to be categorized as a problem:

1. **Entity** <br>The person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>The current characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
3. **Desired state** <br>The desired characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
4. **Momentum** <br>The attempt to change the entity's state from current to desired
5. **Transition** <br>The change in the entity's state from current to desired
6. **Friction** <br>The force slowing or preventing the transition
7. **Obstacle** <br>The source of friction

## Applying my definition to real problems

### Problem analysis Case 1

> I want to be a Full Stack Software Engineer. I found free websites to learn, but I don't know all the necessary topics.

**What components are present**

In this case, the **Entity** is the person, and their **Desired State** is being a Full Stack Software Engineer.

The **Momentum** is their attempt to find learning material with the **Obstacle** being the person not knowing what to specifically learn about.

**What components are not present**

This person's **Current State** is not known, so it isn't instantly clear if overcoming the **Obstacle** will **Transition** the person to their **Desired State**.

**Takeaway**

Intuition tells me that this person's **Desired State** is a long term goal, so there are actually many **Desired States** between their _assumed_ **Current State** and the **Desired State** they mentioned.

Due to this discovery, which I did anticipate, I see that I need to add more fidelity around _why_ I felt the need to write my own definition for "problem".

## Conclusion

I believe if my definition holds weight, all 7 components should be found in all problems, but if they can't, my definition will need additional revisions.

I look forward to putting it to the test.
