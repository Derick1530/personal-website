title: What is a problem?
description: My definition of the term "problem"

I feel it is important to declutter the definition of what a "problem" is so that frameworks for problem categorization, prioritization, and resolution can be created from a solid foundation.

With this in mind, I have been dissatisfied with every definition of the term "problem" I have come across, so I wrote my own.

## My definition

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle adds friction to the transition of an entity from its current state to a desired one.

This definition is compelling because it identifies the 6 components a situation needs to be categorized as a problem:

1. **Entity** <br>The person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>The current characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
3. **Desired state** <br>The new, advantageous characteristics and/or circumstances of the entity
4. **Transition** <br>The action that is intended to change the entity's state from current to desired 
5. **Friction** <br>The force slowing or preventing the transition
6. **Obstacle** <br>The source of friction

## Conclusion 

I believe if my definition holds weight, all 6 components should be found in all problems, but if they can't, my definition will need additional revisions.

I look forward to putting it to the test.
