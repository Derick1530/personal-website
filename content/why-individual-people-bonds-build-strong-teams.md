Bonds between people are the consistent positive experiences they share with each other. The more positive experiences a bond has, the more energy is required to break it, and the more energy the bond generates.

Put in business terms, the more 1-on-1 time team members get with all other team members, the more productive your team will be together due to the strength of each individual bond.
