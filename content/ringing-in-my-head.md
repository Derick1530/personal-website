title: Ringing in My Head
description: A song to my late great-grandfather that I needed to create to escape a spiral of thanatophobia after his passing, all wrote and recorded in less than 8 hours.

Is it peaceful in your mind tonight?<br>
Can you tell me what it's like<br>
To not think at all<br>
And to leave it all behind?<br>
<br>
I want to embrace the dark<br>
Not split silence apart<br>
With the sounds<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
<br>
Is it peaceful where you are tonight?<br>
You know everybody misses you<br>
Can you tell me what it's like<br>
So I won't be scared when I go to?<br>
<br>
I want to embrace the dark<br>
So I can find its light<br>
And these questions will stop<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
<br>
And these fears will stop<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
Ringing in my head<br>
Ringing in my head
