Where is my future?<br>
I want it so bad<br>
Where is my other half?<br>
I've been patient, but it's gaining weight<br>
Why do the perfect ones fail us?<br>
<br>
Wait, there must be a light somewhere<br>
if only it would land on me for a time,<br>
I would capture it, I would capture it<br>
<br>
Wait, there must be a light somewhere<br>
if only it would land on me for a time,<br>
I would capture it, I would capture it<br>
<br>
Just because I walk with wolves doesn't mean I am one<br>
See through the stereotype and into my life<br>
The sun will always rise and the days will pass,<br>
but these feelings of solitude grows ever intruding<br>
If a tree falls and no one is around, does it make sound?<br>
If a tree cries alone, are the principles the same?<br>
<br>
Wait, there must be a light somewhere<br>
if only it would land on me for a time,<br>
I would capture it, I would capture it<br>
<br>
Wait, there must be a light somewhere<br>
if only it would land on me for a time,<br>
I would capture it, I would capture it<br>
<br>
Lucky ones, hold on<br>
Fortunate ones, hold on<br>
The fear of falling keeps most from flying,<br>
but is that an excuse?<br>
<br>
Lucky ones, hold on<br>
