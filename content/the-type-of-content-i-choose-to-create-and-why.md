Historically, I have written "How-To" guides that focused on a handful of specific technologies. Though that strategy allowed me to gain exposure in niche audiences, the shelf life of that content was extremely short and didn't go far in positioning me as a thought leader.

Therefore, I am leaning more into creating content on topics that transcend specific technologies and expose readers to different ways of thinking.
