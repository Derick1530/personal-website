title: What is a “problem“ 4 months later?
description: A less verbose definition of the word “problem“

In March of 2022, I wrote the following definition for the word “problem”, described in detail in my post [What is a “problem”?](/what-is-a-problem).

> “A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction against an entity’s transition from a current state to a desired new state.” <br>- Shadow Smith

In my original post, I identified 7 ingredients that all must be present in order for a problem to exist:

1. **Entity** <br>A person, place, thing, or idea that has a state
2. **Current state** <br>A current characteristic and/or circumstance of the entity
3. **New state** <br>A new characteristic and/or circumstance of the entity
4. **Transition** <br>A change in the entity’s state from a current state to a new state
5. **Obstacle** <br>A source of friction pushing against the transition
6. **Friction** <br>A force capable of stopping a transition
7. **Desire** <br>A want for the entity to be in a specific new state

However, after discussing this idea with colleagues, I am challenging the merits of these ingredients.

## Challenging the 7 ingredients

1. **Entity** <br>A problem always has an entity.
2. **Current state** <br>A problem's entity always has a current state.
3. **New state** <br>A problem's entity can have an unlimited amount of new states, but if a particular new state isn't desired, there is no problem. However, if there is a threat that may change an entity's state to a new undesirable one, a new problem emerges where the subject "entity" becomes the previous entity's current state.
4. **Transition** <be>A problem always contains a transition from an entity's current state to a desired new state.
5. **Obstacles** <br>A problem always contains obstacles, but they are smaller, nested problems that are either _solved_ or _unsolved_.
6. **Friction** <br>A problem’s obstacles _(or smaller nested problems)_ do add friction to an entity’s transition, but the amount of friction indicates how many smaller, nested problems exist along an entity's transition between a current state and a desired new state.
7. **Desire** <br>A desire for an entity to be in a new state is required for a problem to exist.

## The true 5 ingredients

Ultimately, I feel 5 of my original 7 ingredients have held up throughout the evolution of my thinking.

These are:

1. Desire
2. Entity
3. Current state
4. New state
5. Transition

## My new definition

> “A problem is the desire for an entity to be in a specific new state and not a current one.” <br>- Shadow Smith

A problem is _solved_ when the entity can successfully transition from its current state to the desired new one, and _unsolved_ if the entity can not.
