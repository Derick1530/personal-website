In March of 2022, I wrote the following definition for the word “problem”, described in detail in my post [What is a “problem”?](/what-is-a-problem).

> A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction against an entity’s transition from a current state to a desired new state.” <br>- Shadow Smith

Since writing this definition, I have used, shared, and discussed it at length and found where it shines and where it begins to break down.

So now I am revisiting it 4 months later to polish it further.
