In March of 2022, I wrote the following definition for the word “problem”, described in detail in my post [What is a “problem”?](/what-is-a-problem).

> “A problem is a situation where an obstacle applies friction against an entity’s transition from a current state to a desired new state.” <br>- Shadow Smith

Since writing this definition, I have used, shared, and discussed it at length and found where it shines and where it begins to break down.

Now, 4 months later, I am revisiting it.

## My new definition

> “A problem is the desire for an entity to transition from its current state to a new one.” <br>- Shadow Smith

A problem is _solved_ when the entity successfully transitions from its current state to the desired new one and _unsolved_ if the entity can not.
