4 months ago in March of 2022, I decided to try to write my own definition for the word “problem”, and I published [What is a “problem”?](/what-is-a-problem).

Since writing it, I have used, shared, and discussed my definition at length and found where it begins to break down, so now I have revisited it.

# The new definition

> “A problem is the desire for an entity to transition from a current state to a new state.” - Shadow Smith
