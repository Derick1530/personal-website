Building Software for a living has never been a goal of mine. I have always focused on solving problems with code, strategy, and collaboration, and that has lead me to becoming an officially recognized Software Engineer.

As mentioned in the interview, it took me 7 years to land my first _true_ Software Engineering role as a Senior Front-End Engineer at [Openly](https://openly.com), but I was paid to write code soon after finishing the HTML and CSS course on Codecademy.

So if you’re starting your career journey by learning to code, my advice is to build websites, applications, or side projects simply because you enjoy to. 

Don’t chase a title or a large salary. Chase a problem, find your stride, lean in, and never stop learning.

The rest will come.
