> His learning journey took him across several different industries from cattle feed to banking, and it just goes to show how tech touches nearly every field these days. It also highlights that learning to code isn’t necessarily a straight line from A to B, and that’s okay!<br>- Codecademy

Codecademy changed my life, but my “goal” was never to build Software for a living. I was simply focused on solving problems with code, and it lead me to becoming an officially recognized Software Engineer.

As mentioned in the interview, it took me 7 years to land my first _true_ Software Engineering role as a Senior Front-End Engineer, but I was paid to write code as early as 3 or 4 weeks into my journey, right after I took the HTML and CSS course on Codecademy.
