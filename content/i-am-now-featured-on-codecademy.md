> His learning journey took him across several different industries from cattle feed to banking, and it just goes to show how tech touches nearly every field these days. It also highlights that learning to code isn’t necessarily a straight line from A to B, and that’s okay!<br>- Codecademy

Building Software for a living has never been a goal of mine. I was simply focused on solving problems with code, and it lead to becoming an officially recognized Software Engineer.

I found a passion in creating things for the web, and I leaned into it.

As mentioned in the interview, it took me 7 years to land my first _true_ Software Engineering role as a Senior Front-End Engineer at [Openly](https://openly.com), but I was paid to write code soon after finishing the HTML and CSS course on Codecademy.
