Remember when we went to the ocean<br>
And found the perfect shell to take?<br>
Remember when we stayed up all night<br>
Because sleep wasn't necessary?<br>
<br>
Let's change it up<br>
And do something we've never done before<br>
While we can<br>
Because memories are timeline markers<br>
Nothing more<br>
So let's make as many as we can because<br>
<br>
If you stand still, everything you love will fade<br>
If you stand still, everything will fade to grey<br>
So shift, change, warp your always<br>
<br>
Remember when we went to the ocean?<br>
Remember when we stayed up all night?<br>
<br>
If you stand still, everything you love will fade<br>
If you stand still, everything will fade to grey<br>
So shift, change, warp your always<br>
So shift, change, warp your always
