I have a strong, insatiable passion for creating things from nothing, helping people through technology, and mentoring, and today, on my 30th birthday, I read a particular phrase I wrote a long time ago that resonated with me.

That phrase was _**“Show off your mind”**_.

These words move me and align with the act of sharing my individual passions and curiosities, which has absolutely contributed to my rapid growth over the years. 

In addition, it perfectly lines up with the _"work in public"_ mentality I am leaning into more after being inspired by [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [The ReadME Project's post about publishing your work](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work), and a colleague of mine, [Morgan Gao](https://twitter.com/gaomengen), who is building [echojobs](https://echojobs.io).

It is on this day that I define _**“Show off your mind”**_ for myself and intentionally begin to lead my life by it.

> _**“Show off your mind”**_ is a mantra that encourages the sharing of constructive thinking in real-time to increase luck.

Feel free to live yours by it too.
