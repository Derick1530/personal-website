I'm not expecting you to forget what I said,<br>
but I'd like to forget what I did<br>
I'm sorry isn't good enough<br>
Those words don't have the strength<br>
to pull the knife from your side<br>
that I buried so tight<br>
when I was out of my mind<br>
I'm sorry isn't good enough<br>
<br>
I'm not scared of me and you together<br>
We may last forever<br>
Now I'm living day-by-day painting smiles on your face<br>
<br>
What a wonderful day to be a painter<br>
What a wonderful day to be a painter<br>
<br>
I did what I had to do to start over new with you<br>
even though your heart took a bruise<br>
I'm sorry isn't good enough,<br>
but everything will be alright<br>
This time lets take our moments<br>
One breath in line, one step out of our minds, yeah<br>
I'm sorry isn't good enough<br>
<br>
I'm not scared of me and you together<br>
We may last forever<br>
Now I'm living day-by-day painting smiles on your face<br>
<br>
What a wonderful day when you're beside me<br>
gifting chills like a one-ofa-kind daydream symphony<br>
I die inside<br>
knowing I stole tears from their homes in your eyes with my coward lines<br>
I'm done, no more, I'm done<br>
I will never win a battle I always run from<br>
So here I am with my words and my music<br>
to sum it up for you<br>
<br>
I'm not scared anymore<br>
I just want you to know<br>
that I'm not scared anymore<br>
My actions will show you<br>
that I'm not scared<br>
<br>
I'm not scared of me and you together<br>
We may last forever now<br>
I'm living day-by-day painting smiles on your face (that I'm not scared)<br>
<br>

I'm not scared of me and you together<br>
We may last forever now<br>
I'm living day-by-day painting smiles on your face (that I'm not scared)<br>
<br>

I'm not scared of me and you together<br>
We may last forever now<br>
I'm living day-by-day painting smiles on your face (that I'm not scared)<br>
<br>

I'm not scared of me and you together<br>
We may last forever now<br>
I'm living day-by-day painting smiles on your face (that I'm not scared)<br>
<br>

What a wonderful day to be a painter
