I attended a virtual conference called [Block by Block](https://blockbyblock.notion.com) hosted by [Notion](https://www.notion.so), and Ira Glass, host of [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org), was a guest speaker.

During his discussion about scaling the creative process with Notion's COO Akshay Kothari, he began explaining a process he uses to tackle the daunting creative task of converting many hours of interview transcriptions into a story, and I instantly started taking notes as I felt it was broadly applicable.

So here it is.

## The process

As you read through the information you have collected for a piece of content you're working on:

1. Highlight all valuable passages that could be used to tell your content's story.
2. Add 2 asterisks (**) next to the passages that are **vital** for the story.
3. Add 1 asterisk (*) next to passages that enhance the story but could be left out.
4. Write a one line summary of each passage.
5. Put all one line summaries together and organize them to create an outline.
6. Use the outline to begin writing the story.

## In Conclusion

This process is simple, battle-tested, and proven, which is why I believe it resonated with me so strongly.

However, time will tell if it truly is of value to me, but I will try any strategy at least once to see what sticks.
