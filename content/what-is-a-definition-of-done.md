Here's my definition of the concept **Definition of Done**.

> "A Solution has a User and a Provider. A User uses the Solution to reach an objective, while a Provider builds, maintains, and improves the Solution to support the User. However, both the User and Provider have needs <u>before</u> they can confidently interact with the Solution. <mark>Before a Provider releases a new Solution or an improvement to an existing one</mark>, a **Definition of Done** is a guide used by the Provider to ensure the Solution's User and any future Provider can begin or continue to use, build, maintain, or improve the Solution." - Shadow Smith
