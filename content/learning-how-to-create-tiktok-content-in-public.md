## Why TikTok?

For quite a while I’ve been trying to determine how to break into making video content. I made plans to stream on Twitch while I wrote code and also set up a YouTube channel in preparation, but I just couldn’t start.

Being unable to start something new isn’t new to me.

I’ve found myself in a similar place before regarding writing and sharing my thoughts on this very blog, but it was until I figured out how to write and publish blog posts exclusively on my phone, that I _finally_ began sharing all that I’ve had on my mind.

So I have decided to learn TikTok for 2 main reasons:
1. It allows me to create and publish short, high quality video content using just my phone.
2. It’s algorithm is easily the best in the world which increases the odds of my content being seen instead of falling into the void upon publishing.
