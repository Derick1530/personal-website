While Tweeting about “Show off your mind” and thinking about breaking into making video content on TikTok, I randomly came across [“Along” on ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/along). 

Along is a new video based social media app with a TikTok-esque user interface, where you can swipe up and down to go from one piece of content, known as a “tape”, to another. 

Where Along differs, and really stands out in an exciting way, is that a “tape” is a collection of videos called “clips” that creators can infinitely add to over a long span of time.

From there when a user is viewing a tape, they can swipe left and right to go from one clip to another.

This medium is perfect for when you want to “Show off your mind” because you can create a tape for a project and share details about it in clips as you go in real-time.
