## Why TikTok?

For quite a while I’ve been trying to determine how to break into making video content. I made plans to stream on Twitch while I wrote code and also set up a YouTube channel in preparation, but I just couldn’t start.

However, being unable to start something isn’t new to me.

I’ve found myself in a similar place before regarding writing and sharing my thoughts on this very blog. It was until I figured out how to write and publish blog posts exclusively on my phone that I _finally_ began sharing everything on my mind.

So I have decided to learn TikTok for 2 main reasons:
1. It allows me to create and publish short, high quality video content using just my phone.
2. It’s algorithm is easily the best in the world which increases the odds of my content being seen instead of falling into the void upon publishing.

So now that I have chosen TikTok over Twitch or YouTube, I need to determine where to start, and as it turns out, TikTok has a list of [6 key secrets to success](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/foundations-for-success/6-key-secrets-to-success/?enter_method=category_card) that I can use as a jumping off point.

## So where am I going to start?

TikTok says the 1st “key secret to success” is to know your personal brand, and this resonates with me.

I have always had a passion for creating something from nothing and helping others through technology, and many opportunities have emerged by simply sharing my “Why”s consistently over the years.
