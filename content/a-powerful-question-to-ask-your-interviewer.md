It was nearing the end of my 4th round interview for a Software Engineer position at a tech startup, and I was asked by my interviewers if I had any questions for them.

Little did my they know, I was about to force them to show their hand.

I asked:

> After learning all you have about me, what would be a main reason I don’t get hired for this position?

One of the interviewers answered by saying:

> Our VP of Engineering likes to see more experience in testing, and we haven’t gotten a good read on your experience there.

To which, I replied:

> I have written a 2,000 word article on how to build Vue components using Jest for Test Driven Development. I’ll send it to the recruiter right after this interview.

Needless to say, the interviewers and the VP of Engineering were all blown away by the article, and I quickly got the job!

But how does this work?

I specifically designed this question I ask to get interviewers to reveal the difference between what they know about me v.s. who they are looking for.

This creates an opportunity at the 11th hour of the interview to satisfy any objections to my employment and leave a lasting impression on those that are helping determine my fate.
